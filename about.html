## About


Senior software developer focused in environmental applications, websites programming, data processing and prediction. 


#### My way:

I was born in Guadalajara, a small city close to Madrid, Spain. After the university, I was living in Madrid 9 wonderfull years before move to other country. Currently, I am living in Osaka, Japan. 

At highschool It starts to grow on my any interest about Mathematics and specially Physics. For this reason I started to study the Physics Science degree at university of Madrid. My speciality was energy generation (specially nuclear energy) and electrical properties of matter. 


The scientific method had great interest for me. So, I started to work as voluntier into an important scientifics institute of materials my last year at the university. It was a good experience but discovered the speciality on material physics wasn't for me. After any months thinking about my future and working as programmer in a computer consulting company I found my objective, the meteorology and the data processing. It was in this moment when I decided focus my career on meteorological modeling. 

Not only I have been improving my knowledges working into different companies, into different business (weather prediction, climate change, renewables energy) but also developing different personal projects and ideas in my leisure time. Read books, develop with new programming languages and technologies, learn new knowledges are my main hobby (and the cinema, of course), normally without a clear objective. Over the years my interest on software and website development and dataming has been growing and so I am focused in learning and improving myself more about statistical prediction, big data and information and communication technology (ICT) in general, specilly using Python. 


#### Currently focused on:

- Jekyll bootstrap to build a website profile
- Soccer prediction
- Parsing of SYNOP data (climatological data) stored into web server
- GTK Gui development
